<PRE>Hi all,

&gt;<i> As the user interface of the node needs a facelifting urgently, we  
</I>&gt;<i> are going to begin this task on monday. in a first step, we will  
</I>&gt;<i> generate xhtml-valid templates with strictly seperated css  
</I>&gt;<i> stylesheets.
</I>great ;-)

&gt;<i> To finish this milestone, we will sooner or later need the ci  
</I>&gt;<i> guidelines which had been developed for the community portal by the  
</I>&gt;<i> fh vorarlberg. according to the schedule, this task should be  
</I>&gt;<i> accomplished by xmas 2005.
</I>You will hear from us till Xmas

&gt;<i> In 2006, we are going to start a new branch of sotf to implement  
</I>&gt;<i> video functionality. it will be possible to upload video content on  
</I>&gt;<i> the node for other users to download in different resolutions for  
</I>&gt;<i> their ipods (video), mms-cell phones or pdas. this will also be the  
</I>&gt;<i> subject of martin schmidt's diploma thesis.
</I>can contribute some workflows, as i'm currently working on a project  
for a internet provider with the same perspective. Can send you a  
flowchart in the next days.

&gt;<i> As their have been many discussion on this topic but none of it  
</I>&gt;<i> have led to a specification now, we need one day of discussion and  
</I>&gt;<i> specification before xmas. we would be glad to invite you to st.  
</I>&gt;<i> p&#246;lten, but are also willing to come to other places for this meeting.
</I>i'm afraid that i can't travel this year, but i could be a &quot;remote&quot;  
attendee to a meeting via videoconference/IRC/Skype or you would like  
to combine a meeting with some skiing in the vorarlberg alps ;-)

&gt;<i> Questions to be solved for this meeting should include but are not  
</I>&gt;<i> limited to:
</I>&gt;<i> - transcoding
</I>have some research done on this and have a workflow

&gt;<i> - branch management (should sotf generally be video capable or do  
</I>&gt;<i> we have to make a fork)
</I>i would suggest to start with a branch in the SVN and when the  
videofeature has some maturity and stability (at least beta) we can  
discuss to fork it or to merge it back to the &quot;regular&quot; sotf trunk.
For this all of you should read a bit about SVN and branching.
I would prefer to use the branch only for the beginning of the  
development and then merge it back in to get one feature-rich sotf  
node :-)

&gt;<i> - metadata
</I>&gt;<i> - rights management (copyright/-left)
</I>
Greetings from snowy Vorarlberg

Wolfgang
