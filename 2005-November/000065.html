<PRE>Hello everybody,

We made a plan for the next half year, please read &amp; comment:

As the user interface of the node needs a facelifting urgently, we are going to begin this task on monday. in a first step, we will generate xhtml-valid templates with strictly seperated css stylesheets.

To finish this milestone, we will sooner or later need the ci guidelines which had been developed for the community portal by the fh vorarlberg. according to the schedule, this task should be accomplished by xmas 2005.

In 2006, we are going to start a new branch of sotf to implement video functionality. it will be possible to upload video content on the node for other users to download in different resolutions for their ipods (video), mms-cell phones or pdas. this will also be the subject of martin schmidt's diploma thesis.

Our starting content will be the video projects of our students of the past years, but we are also highly interested in discuss with the community tv people about their needs for such a system!

As their have been many discussion on this topic but none of it have led to a specification now, we need one day of discussion and specification before xmas. we would be glad to invite you to st. p&#246;lten, but are also willing to come to other places for this meeting.

Questions to be solved for this meeting should include but are not limited to:
- transcoding
- branch management (should sotf generally be video capable or do we have to make a fork)
- metadata
- rights management (copyright/-left)

All the best from St.P&#246;lten

martin schmidt
matthias husinsky
markus seidl
