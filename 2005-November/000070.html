It would be good to meet early as we will be installing the user  
interfaces we have created for CTV and bug-testing in December. These  
interfaces are rich applications for video metadata, people and roles  
metadata (in LDAP) and archive browsing created in Revolution.

I think it would make sense for you to take a look at these - to help  
with defining the html interface requirements?


&gt;<i> To finish this milestone, we will sooner or later need the ci  
</I>&gt;<i> guidelines which had been developed for the community portal by the  
</I>&gt;<i> fh vorarlberg. according to the schedule, this task should be  
</I>&gt;<i> accomplished by xmas 2005.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In 2006, we are going to start a new branch of sotf to implement  
</I>&gt;<i> video functionality. it will be possible to upload video content on  
</I>&gt;<i> the node for other users to download in different resolutions for  
</I>&gt;<i> their ipods (video), mms-cell phones or pdas. this will also be the  
</I>&gt;<i> subject of martin schmidt's diploma thesis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our starting content will be the video projects of our students of  
</I>&gt;<i> the past years, but we are also highly interested in discuss with  
</I>&gt;<i> the community tv people about their needs for such a system!

Great! We have a by now quite complex database structure and we lack  
proper treatment of audio metadata which can occur as timed elements  
of tracks within video clips or playlists. In terms of the two  
projects collaborating / integrating on a technical level I can think  
of two basic directions:

     1) We link the separate video and audio databases using postGres  
features, but keeping the databases separate.

     2) We integrate the two schemas learning from one and using it  
to extend the second.


&gt;<i> As their have been many discussion on this topic but none of it  
</I>&gt;<i> have led to a specification now, we need one day of discussion and  
</I>&gt;<i> specification before xmas. we would be glad to invite you to st.  
</I>&gt;<i> p&#246;lten, but are also willing to come to other places for this meeting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Questions to be solved for this meeting should include but are not  
</I>&gt;<i> limited to:
</I>&gt;<i> - transcoding
</I>&gt;<i> - branch management (should sotf generally be video capable or do  
</I>&gt;<i> we have to make a fork)
</I>&gt;<i> - metadata
</I>&gt;<i> - rights management (copyright/-left)
</I>
There is an additional requirement from out point of view which is  
looking at the future technical platform to build web applications  
around the database structure. At the moment we have a variety of web  
services written in a combination of perl and php with interact with  
the data model, and rich interfaces written in Revolution which  
operate AJAX style. The aim is to extend this through user testing  
within a flexible design and requirements led process until these  
requirements stabalise and then port the interfaces to full AJAX  
based deployment where appropriate.

This means looking at modern MVC style web application frameworks of  
which there are a number (Ruby on Rails getting the most press at the  
moment), and looking to use the built in object relational mapping  
tools present in such frameworks to create the web application  
framework. This MVC framework can then then be directed to call the  
existing web services and views created in the first stage  
(regardless of which language the web services are created in).

Comments?
