<PRE>::<i> AXMEDIS conference report
</I>
by Roland Alton-Scheidl
30 Nov - 2 DEC 2005, Florence, Italy


AXMEDIS is an FP6 funded project on Production and Disribution of Cross 
Media Content, lasting from 2004-2008.
The size of this EC- Integrated Project is 8,4 MEUR funding with 120 
people working in more than 20 organisations and companies.
They organise a yearly conference, with classical Call for Papers, peer 
reviewing, IEEE publications &amp; poster sessions.
The conference was taking place at Convitta della Calza, a previous 
monastery.

I was presenting a paper and tried to find out, how those really big EC 
funded projects work.

AXMEDIS is about building new value chains around the end-user device 
(iPod, Mobile Phone, PSP, etc). When the business people sayed &quot;Content 
was king&quot; in 2000, now it's worth nothing.  The DEVICE is becoming the 
key to have access to the user. Certification and services are the key 
to monetize content. This view rises a number of questions around 
content production and distribution, which are handled mainly in 
technical sub-groups of the project.

Members of the &quot;Kompetenznetzwerk Mediengestaltung&quot; together with 
streaming media experts had submitted the paper: &quot;StreamOnTheFly - A 
peer-to-peer network for radio stations and podCasters&quot; 
(<A HREF="http://sotf.berlios.de/documents/sotf_paper_2005.pdf">http://sotf.berlios.de/documents/sotf_paper_2005.pdf</A>) and a 
presentation has been given (ppt foils are available at 
<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/docman/?group_id=4561">http://developer.berlios.de/docman/?group_id=4561</A>). There was big 
interest in the StreamOnTheFly p2p network Including the content 
produced at campus radios involved) both from AXMEDIS consortium 
partners such as TISCALI but also from other visitors. At a mini-booth 
the StreamOnTheFly promotion-video was played, which attracted many 
people.


::<i> Academic contacts
</I>
more than 20, with invitations for teacher/students/PhD exchange

_The University of Reading (UK, near London), Mr Atta Badii
_Leeds Metropolitan University (UK), Dr-Ing Reinhold Behringer
_ Fraunhofer (several departments)


::<i> Business contacts
</I>
twr-europe, which supports church-radios (not just catholic churches) 
worldwide, supporting 200 languages, is very interested in using 
StreamOnTheFly, integrated with a Content Management System such as 
PLONE. They may set-up their own node-network and use a separate 
content-topic-tree. Roland Alton-Scheidl will follow-up this contact.

EUTELSAT has been offering bandwidth for metadata or content 
distribution experiments with the StreamOnTheFly network.

TISCALI will be supporting the StreamOnTheFly partners, if they will 
participate in the AXMEDIS take-up call (around 300kEUR per project, 
announcement expected in FEB 2006).

Gracenote offers metadata enhancement for music, they have 7 million 
music fingerprints. They could parse StreamOnTheFly content.


::<i> EC Project Development
</I>
A strategy for a project to be submitted to the IST Call41 until 20 DEC 
2005 has been worked out. Two ad-hoc meetings have been organized  and 
a number of partners have committed themselves to the proposal writing 
procedure for a &quot;Network of Excellence on Hybrid Copyright in 
Audiovisual Media&quot;. The paradime shift with re-usage of content and p2p 
content sharing has been also addressed as the major issue for 
deploying future media content on various distribution channels by the 
keynote speaker, Mr Chiariglione. Usability would be a key factor for 
open Digital Rights Management systems.

A Network of Excellence gives funds for a given number of researchers 
(20kEUR/person/year) who work on the project, but the usage of money is 
open. Expected output is publications, further proposals, set up living 
labs, perform experience research.
Priority members for an NoE proposal:
_multi-sectorial users: tourism, commercial, non-profit, educational - 
put one lead/gateway partner in
_researchers
_gateway organisations
_industry &amp; telco (e.g. BBC archive)

We have been looking at the structure of other successful NoEs:
NoE &quot;humaine&quot;:  <A HREF="http://www.emotion-research.net">http://www.emotion-research.net</A>
NoE &quot;enactive&quot;: <A HREF="http://www.enactive.org">http://www.enactive.org</A>

Mr Atta Badii will contact CEC officer Amir Alicani and he will request 
feedback on the draft summary. A WIKI has been set up with a draft 
proposal structure. A proposal shall be worked out jointly and will be 
submitted on 20 DEC 05. Fachhochschule Vorarlberg's UCT (among others) 
will be invited as a partner. Ideal co-ordinator would be an 
independent research organisation.

::<i> Documentation
</I>
Proceedings and Industrial Papers are available, as well as several CD 
compilations with documnets and software.
