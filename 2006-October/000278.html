<PRE>Hi,

I agree with Herbert on this. I just counted the stations that have between 0 and 2 programs and got 13 stations (out of a 36 station total, which is more than a third!). Most of these stations have not been used for a long time and somehow take away &quot;room&quot; from the regular contributors (they actually don't but these &quot;dead bodies&quot; are an annoyance, if you know what I mean).

On the other hand these problems appear when using the nodes as main interface for the stations. As I understood it from the technical documentation the original intention for the nodes was to provide the archive and then have portals from the radio stations to access their own content (via RSS) or other kinds of portals. We should keep in mind that the node was not meant to be the main interface.

Anyway, it should be recommended that if you are an institution or person which programmes to more than one topic to use the series instead of creating stations that are hardly used. And maybe we should do a little cleanup...

cheers,
Matthias

Betreff: [Sotf-general] station or not station

sorry to say but in my opinion its not really good practice to create a certain station for a particular temporal project. such a kind the number of stations might increase quickly and therefore complicate user's orientation.

furthermore it becomes very difficult for us (orange 94.0) to explain to our contributors why their own series are not assigned as certain stations too. that's a frequently asked question, mostly argued with station's better visibleness. at time we have about 30 series, means about 30 aspriants for dedicated stations if we don't keep a more stringent definition.

best
herbert
