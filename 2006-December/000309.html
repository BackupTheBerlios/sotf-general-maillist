<PRE>Dear Community,

First I want to thank Laszlo, Andr&#225;s and Roland for giving us honest feedback on our recent works. To be honest, we hoped that more feedback from the community would be contributed. 
We discussed the critizised points and came to the conclusion that some points should indeed be changed, but some of the issues are, in our opinion, an improvement to the current version which is why we&#146;ll keep them.

As we are pretty sure that we&#146;ll use this branch in St.P&#246;lten for our own purposes and others might do so as well, we are going to make the code available in a new branch in the source tree. We find starting a new branch far from optimal but the only compromise given the current state of disagreement. We are aware that some improvements are still nescessary (and a redesign would be a nice thing :), but sooner or later our new branch and the existing &#132;video_test&#147; branch are to be placed together again.
Unfortunately we cannot say yet, whether or not we&#146;ll have resources for the continued work in the upcoming year.

However, we also think that another sprint would be a good thing
- to decide how to continue with the network (make the move to video or not)
- and if yes, to merge the branches, so some debugging and improving

We'd like to wish everybody a cosy christmas and a happy new year. Hopefully you all get some time off :)

All the best,
Matthias, Markus, Christian and Klaus

</PRE>
