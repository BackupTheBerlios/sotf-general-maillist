<PRE>Dear Matthias,

Sorry not to able to test your new interface in details before. I've  
just looked at it now immediately revealed some trivial user  
interface problems (using Safari, Firefox, and Camino browsers on a  
MAC).

If you increase  (or decrease) the fontsize of the UI, than the whole  
UI is completely disorganized, main menu disappears, flags for  
language change move to different strange places, thus we can't use  
the system at all. This is a real general problem.

Also the limited width page design makes a strange effect on  
usability (prevents it, as you will see it below).

Seems that the new UI has much less quality from pure usability point  
of view. A system like this should concentrate on the usability at  
first.

The new advanced search panel does not describe how it works, whether  
it is conjunctive of disjunctive.

Station list does not provide the logo of the stations thus this list  
is much less usable.

Topic tree handling is less usable as well as you put the hitlist  
after the subtree that can be very long thus scrolling is almost  
always necessary to reach the real content. Again a serious problem  
that the limited width page design causes.

Sorry but the whole is much less usable from general UI functionality  
point of view. I suggest to consult a senior expert who has an  
extensive practice in general UI design.

The individual colors are great, using them together is really awful  
from pure esthetics point of view, BTW.

</I>&gt;<i> we would like to contribute our changes into the svn tree.  
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately we did not recieve a lot of feedback after our last

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> anyway, we are confident that the version we developed works  
</I>&gt;<i> stable. it surely still has some issues but most of those were  
</I>&gt;<i> beyond our scope of restructuring the interface.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> but before we can even think about merging our source into the tree  
</I>&gt;<i> we first should get an overview of what is already here and where  
</I>&gt;<i> to put our code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> at the moment there is one trunk and 3 branches to be found in  
</I>&gt;<i> berlios' svn:
</I>&gt;<i> * trunk: this is probably the latest stable audio node release,  
</I>&gt;<i> like the nodes running at <A HREF="http://medienarchiv.fh-stpoelten.ac.at">http://medienarchiv.fh-stpoelten.ac.at</A> or  
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://radio.sztaki.hu/node/">http://radio.sztaki.hu/node/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> * branch: payable - the payable etension andras developed in the  
</I>&gt;<i> recent months. i guess it is based on the trunk.
</I>&gt;<i> * branch: video_test: the video capable version of sotf developed  
</I>&gt;<i> mainly by martin schmidt. we built our current version upon this one.
</I>&gt;<i> * branch: sztaki_dsd: assumably one of sztaki's developements, but  
</I>&gt;<i> no further details available
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> is this correct?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> looking at these proceedings i would like to ask the question where  
</I>&gt;<i> to go from here. we do have a trunk and two branches. we're  
</I>&gt;<i> obviously going to merge our source into the video_test branch as  
</I>&gt;<i> this was our basis. then, how do we cope with the different versions?
</I>&gt;<i> a move from the sysadmins to our video branch would be preferrable  
</I>&gt;<i> for the following reasons:
</I>&gt;<i> - the video node can also be used as pure audio node (by switch in  
</I>&gt;<i> the config).
</I>&gt;<i> - the video node will then have a WAI conform interface that can be  
</I>&gt;<i> styled via pure css
</I>&gt;<i> - audio and video nodes can coexist in a network
</I>&gt;<i> nevertheless it is important that all the nodes on the network  
</I>&gt;<i> update to the new version since only the new nodes (even if they  
</I>&gt;<i> provide audio only) can pass the video metadata on to other nodes.  
</I>&gt;<i> as soon as two video providing nodes are on the network, this is  
</I>&gt;<i> nescessary. we did quite some tests to proove that it is working.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> what do you think is best? we obviously should discuss this in  
</I>&gt;<i> detail as the video extension is a major step in the network's  
</I>&gt;<i> history. it would probably be best if we set up a new test network  
</I>&gt;<i> on different locations to proove it extensively before we do the  
</I>&gt;<i> final move. we'll start with a clean node next week an will provide  
</I>&gt;<i> the source for you to test.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> finally, we'll need somebody with the access permission to the svn  
</I>&gt;<i> (and also the experience with merging) to help us since we don't  
</I>&gt;<i> have either of those.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> thanks for your attention - i hope we'll get lots of feedback.
</I>&gt;<i> all the best,
</I>&gt;<i> matthias
