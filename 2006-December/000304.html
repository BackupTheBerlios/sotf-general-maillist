<PRE>Hi All,

&gt;<i> we in st.p&#246;lten did quite some work in the last few month to bring the
</I>&gt;<i> sotf node interface to another level. now comes the point where we would
</I>&gt;<i> like to contribute our changes into the svn tree. unfortunately we did
</I>&gt;<i> not recieve a lot of feedback after our last call to test our node at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://sotf.fh-stpoelten.ac.at/node_884/">http://sotf.fh-stpoelten.ac.at/node_884/</A>
</I>
I think it is a great thing that SOTF has a CSS based layout. However, I 
admit, that I have some comments on it:
- I will not comment on the colours as those may be changed easily now, I 
hope :-) There are some nice parts of the design, the content links for 
example, and some lists with the action-icons.
- The original search interface had more opportunities than this, for 
example one could search for an interval of broadcast date (from-until)
- The station list could have an expanded view where all icons are shown
- The layout of the topics list is not fortunate, as Laszlo wrote. Too much 
sscrolling will be the result.
- The station view is compact, gives a good overview for me, again at the 
price of hiding all icons.
- The main problem of the program view is that too much scrolling is needed 
to get to the content. In the design made by our Italian guest student, she 
put the metadata and content links side-by-side, so the content could be 
reached without scrolling. In case of video, now there is the preview part, 
but the preview part could contain the link to start watching the content. 
It would be nice to have a preview part for audio as well :-) Some audio 
curves maybe? :-)
- There are problems with the layout as well. With large fonts it very 
easily breaks apart.

I know that making pure CSS design is very tricky, but if this goes against 
usability, then the principles of pure CSS could be alleviated...

&gt;<i> at the moment there is one trunk and 3 branches to be found in berlios'
</I>&gt;<i> svn: * trunk: this is probably the latest stable audio node release, like
</I>&gt;<i> the nodes running at <A HREF="http://medienarchiv.fh-stpoelten.ac.at">http://medienarchiv.fh-stpoelten.ac.at</A> or
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://radio.sztaki.hu/node/">http://radio.sztaki.hu/node/</A> * branch: payable - the payable etension
</I>&gt;<i> andras developed in the recent months. i guess it is based on the trunk. 
</I>&gt;<i> * branch: video_test: the video capable version of sotf developed mainly
</I>&gt;<i> by martin schmidt. we built our current version upon this one. * branch:
</I>&gt;<i> sztaki_dsd: assumably one of sztaki's developements, but no further
</I>&gt;<i> details available
</I>This branch was created for us, but honestly we never used it...

&gt;<i> is this correct?
</I>Yes.

I have no experience in merging branches with svn, but originally svn was 
chosen because this task is easier there as in cvs.
