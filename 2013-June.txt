Hi everyone,

SOTF provided an extremely reliable online archive to us for nearly 6 
years. Thanks a lot to everyone concerned, particularly to Andras, who 
supported us instantly anytime needed. You did a great job, SOTF is 
still a very lovely piece of code!

But regrettably development of the code was finished years ago. Due to 
this (and in fact reasons of synergistic effects) we decided to merge 
with the official archive of VFROE (association of austrian community 
radios) CBA.

The transfer was already finished in january, SOTF's clear structure 
made it as easy as possible. Thanks to Apache's powerful mod_rewrite and 
it's facility to run external scripts, it was possible to redirect all 
requests automaticaly from http://sendungsarchiv.o94.at to the adequate 
new location at http://cba.fro.at

At this moment the old archive is still running as http://sotf.o94.at - 
but now it's it's time to take it down, we will do this tomorrow, 
thursday 12th june.

Best regards
Herbert
