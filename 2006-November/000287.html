<PRE>Dear SOTF Community,

Some of you might have followed our work on our developement node - now we are ready to present it to you. Please have a look at:

<A HREF="http://sotf.fh-stpoelten.ac.at/node_884/">http://sotf.fh-stpoelten.ac.at/node_884/</A>
l/p: testuser/usertest

This node features the following improvements:
WAI conform interface: The node templates are XHTML compliant and can be fomatted entirely via CSS.
New design: Toghether with the new templates we changed the design of the node interface. The design is entirely CSS based and can be easily adjusted to your own needs.
Change of the page structure:&#160;
As you will find out pretty quickly, we changed the page layout in a way, that the side columns available on the start page (in the original interface) are now on every subpage. The login panel on the left top changes to some kind of user preferences panel containing all the regarding links when logged in. These links used to be in the top navigation.

Topics: we replaced the frame layout from the original node with a more clearly arranged one. We hope that this makes the topics categories easier to read.
New flash video player: To reduce server load this player will only load the movie preview when clicked. Additionally you can now jump back and forward.
some other smaller changes
It was a lot of work, still there is more to do as you may find out easily. 
We introduced some new smarty varibles that have to be translated
We (re)discovered some older bugs in the backend that ought to be fixed by somebody in the community
The help has to be updated (eg. for the video stuff) and translated into all the available languages (we'll probably do the german version)

Some usability weirdnesses we want to question.
A detailed list of these issues will come soon. When we have finished the most important ones and incorporated your feedback our next step will the merge of the code into the repository.

I'm sure you've got lots of feedback for us - for now: happy testing :)

greetings from St.P&#246;lten,
Christian, Klaus, Markus and Matthias
