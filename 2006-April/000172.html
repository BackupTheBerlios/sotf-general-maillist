<PRE>Dear SOTF community,

We are happy to present you a renewed portal for the SOTF project. The aim of the portal is to be the central source for information regarding SOTF. Especially newbies should get an overview on what SOTF is about.

Although the portal is not finished completely yet, you might want to take a look and share comments on the outlook and comments. Keeping in mind our nomination in the Stockholm Challange it would be cool if everybody helped a little here and there to bring the site into a final state soon. 

Long story short, here is the link:
<A HREF="http://sotf.fh-stpoelten.ac.at:8080/sotf">http://sotf.fh-stpoelten.ac.at:8080/sotf</A>

Some comments from me:
As you can see, the site does not contain all the content it should have. Some texts (eg. the history of SOTF) and almost all the images are missing to this point. What also would be really important to have are some tutorials/walkthroughs on how to use SOTF. If somebody could contribute these the page would be more complete than it is now.

The texts were written to give the reader a short and comprehensive introduction to SOTF. I hope that I achieved this goal but am of course open for other suggestions/extensions/changes. Please give me your comments. You can also register on the page and write your own pages (user registration will not be publicly accessible in the final version).

Allright, I am looking forward to get loads of feedback :)
Have a nice weekend,

Matthias

PS: For those who don't know: It was decided at the last official SOTF meeting at the end of march that the portal should be rebuilt. The current one is highly outdated...

</PRE>
