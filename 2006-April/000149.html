<PRE>Hello,

I'm sorry to say but this mail surprises me as the SQL-script has been 
sent to the list already on February 6 for everyone to have a look at it.

Anyway: It is true that I forgot to adapt the sotf_node_objects table. 
But as I see it, there are only the entries with the now unnecessary IDs

001td128 - 001td260
001to128ger - 001to260ger
001to128eng - 001to260eng
001to128fra - 001to260fra
001to128hun - 001to260hun

which will have to be deleted. I could add the proper SQL statements to 
the script for the database to be kept clean. As I see it, additions 
would not be necessary as the new topic IDs range consistently from 0 to 
127 - and all of these have their equivalent in sotf_topics, 
sotf_topic_tree_defs and sotf_prog_topics. So, no SQL error should occur.

Concerning the chaos theory: I don't like solution 1a as this would not 
make the system less complex - that's the opposite of what we wanted by 
creating the simplified topic tree...

Solution 1b sounds good but is not quite clear to me. Does this mean 
that I have to reassign all new IDs to the new topics, continuing the 
old schema with 261? Else, would change_stamp=1 be enough to differ old 
and new topics in the case RadioSwap syncs? How would this way work exactly?

(Besides, is there no contact at all with RadioSwap? Couldn't they 
switch to SVN, too? Then, every existent node would have the capability 
to update the topic tree. The only one left - according to the map on 
streamonthefly.org *g* - would be &quot;ste-audiorating.dh.uclv.net&quot;, but 
this URL is not reachable...)

Regarding point 2, i suppose the same process as in install.php 
(delete/create vocabularies) is meant...

I would like to invite everybody who knows what's the problem about to 
contribute their thoughts to the discussion. Together, we'll maybe find 
a practicable, good and lbnl efficient solution for the problem as I 
would like to continue focusing on the video extension to get it 
finished in time... :)

Greetings,
Martin

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had a more careful thought on this, and I DO NOT RECOMMEND to change 
</I>&gt;<i> topic trees as it is now. Sorry for saying it now, but there are some 
</I>&gt;<i> dangers in it:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - sotf_node_objects table is untouched by the update process: each 
</I>&gt;<i> synchronised object has an entry in this table. As Martin directly 
</I>&gt;<i> adds/deletes objects using SQL commands, the node_objects table should 
</I>&gt;<i> be manually edited as well: additions and deletions should be done. 
</I>&gt;<i> Or, by using the save() method of sotf_NodeObject class this can be 
</I>&gt;<i> done automatically (see sotf_Vocabularies::importTopicTree)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - The change in the topic tree makes a change &quot;without history&quot;: the 
</I>&gt;<i> old tree disappears, it is replaced by the new one. What happens when 
</I>&gt;<i> an existing node installed some years before (e.g. the Belgian 
</I>&gt;<i> RadioSwap) accidentally joins the network? big chaos!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My suggestion is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.a. either insert the modified tree as a completely new tree and make 
</I>&gt;<i> it the default,
</I>&gt;<i> 1.b. or insert it with change_stamp=1 and create the proper 
</I>&gt;<i> sotf_deletion objects for deleted topics
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In both cases if some node with the old tree joins the network, the 
</I>&gt;<i> old tree will not overwrite the new one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Use/extend the sotf_Vocabularies class to import the updated tree 
</I>&gt;<i> (instead of raw SQL), because it takes care of some things under the 
</I>&gt;<i> hood...
</I>&gt;<i> (or create the necessary changes for the sotf_node_objects table, 
</I>&gt;<i> which will be hard)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or there might be some simpler solution, which I did not notice...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the admin section, there is now a link &quot;Update topic tree&quot;. A 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> click on it runs the script in admin.php, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - replaces the old topic tree
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - maps all programmes' topic id's to the accordant new ones
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - checks for possible duplicate topic entries (e.g. a programme with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the old topics &quot;handball&quot; and &quot;football&quot; cannot have the new topic 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;sport&quot; twice, as sotf_prog_topics does only allow unique entries).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The topictree_sotf_*.txt-files in code/share have also been updated 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in all four languages (thx andras!), so newly installed nodes will 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have automatically the new topic tree.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It would be best if the running nodes switch to the new tree 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> approximately simultaneous. So there will be no conflicting topic 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> id's when syncs are done. But maybe, there is also another solution 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for it i might not have thought about...?
