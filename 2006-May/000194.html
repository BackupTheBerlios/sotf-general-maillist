<PRE>hi everyone,

sorry for delay, i was quite busy. here is the bug report from o94
update installation. only 2.a) 'problems with handling of audiofiles' is
a really serious prob and should be fixed as soon as possible.

best
herbert



===========================
1. PROBLEMS ON INSTALLATION
===========================

a) damaged file in SVN
----------------------
www/static/close.png was damaged after check out - 1 byte missing

b) unnecessary new lines in files from SVN
------------------------------------------
some files have got lots of unnecessary new lines. this prohibites use
of diff and makes it very difficult to find out, what's been changed at
all. because we're using several files in modified versions this is
essential to us, we have to find out the differences everytime updating
the node.

==================
2. PROBLEMS ON USE
==================

a) urgent problems with handling of audiofiles
----------------------------------------------
since the update encoding of other audio formats mostly doesn't work. we
have troubles on converting other formats with lots of uploaded audio
files (mp3 as well as ogg encoded by different soundeditors/encoders) -
for example see <A HREF="http://sendungsarchiv.o94.at/get.php?id=094pr507">http://sendungsarchiv.o94.at/get.php?id=094pr507</A>

it's no more only the well known problem with mp3-files encoded by
audacity/lame under linux (not being recognized as audio-files or
producing error 'length parameter must be greater 0' in the editor's
console. annoyingly same combination audacity/lame run under windows
makes no troubles at all). after running toolame on affected files
manually the problem is fixed. the reason for that phaenomen is not
exactly known, but it is definitely related to getid3.

i remember some work has to be done before a newer version of getid3 may
be implemented, does anyone know what's exactly to do in that matter? is
there any hope for an upcoming solution?

b) reload of origin browser window (editmeta &amp; co)
--------------------------------------------------
on adding topics to a broadcast or editors to a serie (means any
operation which opens a second browser window for the menue) the reload
of the origin window sometimes doesn't work. so people don't see the
changes immediately and may get confused. on closing the menue-window
the origin window is reloaded properly everytime.

c) editmeta - save all the data above
-------------------------------------
on adding a new broadcast it should be impossible to leave the main
section without saving. at this point users can loose access to an
uploaded broadcast. if a new broadcast is not saved it may not appear in
editor's console anymore, sometimes we faced this problem.

d) remove from series
---------------------
remove from series (editmeta) is not a correct description of this
button's effect. broadcast is not only removed from serie but also from
any further access by editor (if not station admin at least). either
this should be named 'delete broadcast' or the audiofile should be
accessible in editor's menue again.

e) status un/published
----------------------
on changing the status un/published (editor's console) the colour is not
changed anymore until manualy reload of the page (or next visit). this
seems to be rather a minor prob.

f) search
---------
search for ratings still this does not work (same situation as before).
for better understandability we would also suggest to change the order
of fields as to see at <A HREF="http://sendungsarchiv.o94.at/advsearch.php">http://sendungsarchiv.o94.at/advsearch.php</A>


==============
3. SUGGESTIONS
==============

a) chooseable languages
-----------------------
list of chooseable languages should be completed. there are are some
language missing in the dropdown of metadata menue, for instance asiatic
and arabic ones.

b) help
-------
the help (linked in the public menubar) is a help for admins. regular
visitors may be frightened. the version found at
<A HREF="http://medienarchiv.fh-stpoelten.ac.at/help/index.eng.html#index">http://medienarchiv.fh-stpoelten.ac.at/help/index.eng.html#index</A> shows
quite specialy elaborated pictures inbound... ;)
