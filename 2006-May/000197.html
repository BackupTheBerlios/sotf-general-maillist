<PRE>hello,

i'm proud to present you the brand new sotf video node! :)

some of the features are:
    - wide variety of video formats supported (all ffmpeg can eat... *g*)
    - conversion per default into
        3gp (for mobile phones)
        mp4 (for quicktime player, compatible with ipod video!)
        wmv (for windows media player)
    - ffmpeg commands might be individually edited in config.inc.php
    - preview on get.php realized with
        stills (100% black, green or whatever frames are omitted)
        flash video-player
    - dynamic output of conversion progress in editFiles.php
    - metadata can be edited while conversion is still running
    - user-friendly advanced search (!!!)
    - statistics on index.php with detailed audio/video-information
    - getid3-1.7.5 implemented -&gt; makes things easier
    - the new topic tree... :)

known bugs:
    - some page content is not translated yet in all four languages
    - the flash video-player is not placed directly on get.php, but in a
    popup (see pps for details)
    - videos are not yet converted into psp-compatible format

you can see (and test) the whole thing running on:
    &gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://sotf.fh-stpoelten.ac.at/node_881">http://sotf.fh-stpoelten.ac.at/node_881</A>

there is a little neighbourhood installed - for sync testing:
    node_881 &lt;<A HREF="http://sotf.fh-stpoelten.ac.at/node_881">http://sotf.fh-stpoelten.ac.at/node_881</A>&gt; (video) -&gt; 
node_882 &lt;<A HREF="http://sotf.fh-stpoelten.ac.at/node_882">http://sotf.fh-stpoelten.ac.at/node_882</A>&gt;  (audio) -&gt; node_883 
&lt;<A HREF="http://sotf.fh-stpoelten.ac.at/node_883">http://sotf.fh-stpoelten.ac.at/node_883</A>&gt;  (video)

notice that node 883 gets its video programmes only via the &quot;normal&quot;
audio node, whose sync routine has not been changed at all! however, the
video programmes are hidden on the audio node (statistics are also
restricted to audio programmes).

the only thing necessary for audio nodes to get along with video
programmes is a svn update and a run of update.sql, which adds a few
necessary fields in the database.

there has been a account created for all of you on all three nodes:
testuser/testuser (of course, you have both administrator and editor
rights.)

i have just configured the ftp server as it should be, so you can access
your user directory (on node 881) via
    &gt;&gt; <A HREF="ftp://testuser:testuser@sotf.fh-stpoelten.ac.at:8989">ftp://testuser:testuser@sotf.fh-stpoelten.ac.at:8989</A>

you can, of course, install your own node from the svn video-branch,
too. in this case, you need an up-to-date ffmpeg version. (under debian,
use: &quot;deb <A HREF="ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/">ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/</A> sarge main&quot; in your 
sources.list)

so now please test the video node and submit any found bugs, problems or
suggestions - and be aware of the fact that i am 100% available to
correct/implement them only until may 31... :)

happy testing!
greetings martin


ps: please send your messages not only to the list, but
directly to <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sotf-general">ptmschmidt at fh-stpoelten.ac.at</A> as well. there has recently been
severe problems with it. i already wrote a version of this mail yesterday at
6 pm, but it has never been forwarded...

pps: we were not able to get our flv-files working properly in our (or
any) flash video-player. the user had to wait on get.php for the whole
flv to load (which might take a while... *g*) before he could leave to
an other page. probably, some metadata is missing in the flv-files
created with ffmpeg. any ideas concerning this problem?
