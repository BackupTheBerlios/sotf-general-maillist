<PRE>Will look at this in more detail on the weekend.

Would need to look at the application in detail, but at first glance  
would strongly disagree. CC would allow us to bring on board some  
heavy weight partners - particularly from the UK (Creative Archive  
Group, Creative Commons International and BBC). They are very well  
connected strategically in EU circles, and the pressure you refer to  
is in my experience from the Open Source / radical community  
disputing  license related issues / Art Libre etc or are you thinking  
of something else?

Ok - looked at call summary. Agree that commercial and DRM management  
stuff needs to be upfront emphasised and perhaps not CC - but we can  
combine both by having an internal CC strategy agreed with partners  
(above) and emphasise in the proposal the tech aspect (see below).

&gt;<i> I do not suggest the NoE as it does not offer enough support for  
</I>&gt;<i> development.
</I>
Lost here - do you mean SOTF &quot;node&quot;? What is NoE - google doesn't  
help me :)

&gt;<i> A big IP would be ideal with some large partners.
</I>
Therefore BBC and there involvement in tv-anytime.org. I have  
contacts there and will see if they are interested.

&gt;&gt;<i> The strategic objective &quot;Networked Audio Visual Systems and Home  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Platforms&quot; will have an additional call for proposals in the IST  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> programme: they are looking for 2-3 really big projects and some  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> networks for excellence. This would be an excellent chance to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> submit a follow-up project for StreamOnTheFly, extending it with  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the scope for video, or integrating EPG collaborative filtering,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or offering a CC publishing suite.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I had tried a proposal once in the objective &quot;Networked Audio  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Visual Systems and Home Platforms&quot;, in 2003, but failed. The  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal was focussing on content clearing, see <A HREF="http://www.pvl.at/">http://www.pvl.at/</A> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> research/fp6/pvldocument_view
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They did not like, that we mix policy making and establishing new  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technologies.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you are interested to join a consortium, please indicate, which  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parts of the proposal you would be able to re-phrase.
</I>
All of it :) Seriously - I think it needs to be built around tv- 
anytime.org specs with some big partners and there agendas - within  
this we can embed and develop the CC aspects of the spec... while  
keeping the DRM stuff upfront???

&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe somebody is able to go to Brussels on Oct 18th.
</I>
I would be interested in going - for the day - but would need to  
justify the travel budget and ensure that my inadequate project  
management skills are not missed too much :) I will talk to Paula  
when she comes over next week - so any progress by then would be great.
